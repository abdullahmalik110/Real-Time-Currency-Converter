## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| C++17 | Core programming language |
| Qt 6 (Widgets + Network) | GUI framework & HTTP requests |
| nlohmann/json | JSON parsing (single header) |
| fawazahmed0/currency-api | Free live exchange rate API |

## 📐 OOP Concepts Applied

| Concept | Where Used |
|---|---|
| **Classes & Objects** | `MainWindow`, `ApiFetcher` |
| **Encapsulation** | API logic fully isolated in `ApiFetcher` |
| **Abstraction** | `MainWindow` doesn't know HOW rates are fetched |
| **Inheritance** | Inherits from `QMainWindow`, `QObject` |
| **Signals & Slots** | Qt's event-driven OOP communication pattern |
| **Single Responsibility** | Each class has one clear job |

## ⚙️ Installation & Build

### Requirements

- [Qt 6](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source) (with MinGW 64-bit on Windows)
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.3/json.hpp) single header

### Step 1 — Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/currency-converter.git
cd currency-converter
```

### Step 2 — Download json.hpp

Download and place in the `libs/` folder:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -L -o libs/json.hpp \
  https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.3/json.hpp
```

**Windows** — open this URL in your browser and save to `libs\json.hpp`:
```
https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.3/json.hpp
```

### Step 3 — Build

**Qt Creator (All platforms):**
1. Open `currency_converter.pro` in Qt Creator
2. Click **Configure Project**
3. Press `Ctrl + B` to build
4. Press `Ctrl + R` to run

**Linux / macOS Terminal:**
```bash
cd build
qmake ../currency_converter.pro
make -j4
./CurrencyConverter
```

**Windows (Qt MinGW Terminal):**
```cmd
cd build
qmake ..\currency_converter.pro
mingw32-make
CurrencyConverter.exe
```

## 🌐 API Used

**[fawazahmed0/currency-api](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api)**

- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ No API key required
- ✅ 170+ currencies
- ✅ Updates daily

**Endpoint used:**
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies/usd.json
```

**Rate conversion formula:**
```
result = amount × (toRate / fromRate)
```
All rates are relative to USD as the base currency.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `json.hpp not found` | Download it and place in `libs/` folder |
| `QNetworkAccessManager` error | Make sure `network` is in your `.pro` QT modules |
| App shows "Network error" | Check your internet connection |
| Blank result on conversion | Wait for rates to load (status bar shows progress) |
| Build fails on Qt 5 | Upgrade to Qt 6 or adjust `#include` paths |
